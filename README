From the Project Euler website (http://projecteuler.net):

"Project Euler exists to encourage, challenge, and develop the skills
and enjoyment of anyone with an interest in the fascinating world of
mathematics."

These are my solutions to some of the problems. I don't usually have
much time to spare, but I'm quite fascinated by the project and try to
solve a problem every now and then. A long way to go, as currently
there are 365+ problems.
